# AoC 2021 - day 2
# Input file shows instructions to the submarine.
#
# Part 1: Each bit in the gamma/epsilon rate can be determined by finding the 
#         most/least common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers 
#         in the diagnostic report.
#
#         Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the 
#         gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. What is the
#         power consumption of the submarine? 
# Part 2:  - To find oxygen generator rating, determine the most common value 
#            (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with
#            that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep
#            values with a 1 in the position being considered.
#          - To find CO2 scrubber rating, determine the least common value 
#            (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with
#            that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep
#            values with a 0 in the position being considered.
#
#         Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the 
#         oxygen generator rating and CO2 scrubber rating, then multiply them 
#         together. What is the life support rating of the submarine?
