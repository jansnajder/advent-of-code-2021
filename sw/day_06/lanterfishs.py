# AoC 2021 - day 6
# Input file shows initial ages of lantern-fishes.
#
# Lantern-fish with an internal timer value of 3:
#
#   - After one day, its internal timer would become 2.
#   - After another day, its internal timer would become 1.
#   - After another day, its internal timer would become 0.
#   - After another day, its internal timer would reset to 6, and it would create a new lantern-fish with an internal
#     timer of 8.
#   - After another day, the first lantern-fish would have an internal timer of 5, and the second lantern-fish would
#     have an internal timer of 7.
#
# Part 1:  - How many lantern-fishes will be there after 80 days?
# Part 2:  - How many lantern-fishes will be there after 256 days?
