## Advent of code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for most of the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) tasks.

### Language

This was my first year participating in Advent of Code (AoC), so as language I have chosen `Python`.


### Structure

The `cm` folder contains requirements for all the solutions. The `sw` folder contains the actual solutions.

In `sw` folder each folder contains solution for one day of AoC - each day consists of two tasks. Together with Python script, the folder further contains the input of the task as well as folder with test inputs (these were used during solving the task).
